## Azure Management Plane vs Data Plane
_Note: Developing a new service requires the development of at least 1 (management plane) API and potentially one or more additional (data plane) APIs.  When reviewing v1 service APIs, we see common advice provided during the review._

A **management plane** API is implemented through the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and is used to provision and control the operational state of resources.
A **data plane** API is used by developers to implement applications. Occasionally, some operations are useful for provisioning/control and applications. In this case, the operation can appear in both APIs.
Although, best practices and patterns described in this document apply to all HTTP/REST APIs, they are especially important for **data plane** services because it is the primary interface for developers using your service. The **management plane** APIs may have other preferred practices based on the conventions of the [Azure RPC](https://aka.ms/azurerpc).
