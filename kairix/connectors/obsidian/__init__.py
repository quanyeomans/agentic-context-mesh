"""Obsidian connector plugin — filesystem-backed markdown knowledge stores.

First-party :class:`kairix.core.protocols.SourceConnector` implementation
for Obsidian-style markdown directories. Discovers files under a vault
root, tracks change events via :mod:`watchdog` filesystem notifications,
and periodically runs a full-scan reconciliation pass to catch events
that fired while the worker was paused. Deep-links resolve to the
``obsidian://`` URL scheme so retrieval results round-trip back into
the operator's editor.

Registered via ``[project.entry-points."kairix.connectors"]`` in
kairix's ``pyproject.toml`` — operators select it by listing
``obsidian`` in their ``connectors[]`` config. Third-party connector
plugins follow the same entry-point shape (see
``docs/architecture/connector-ingestion-architecture.md`` §8).

The plugin is mypy-strict-clean and carries ``py.typed`` per F41. The
``SourceConnector`` Protocol surface is narrow by design (F35 / F38) —
chunking, signal extraction, and Bronze persistence live in
:mod:`kairix.core.connectors`, never inside the connector itself.

See ``tests/bdd/features/connector_obsidian.feature`` for the
behaviour spec this plugin pins.
