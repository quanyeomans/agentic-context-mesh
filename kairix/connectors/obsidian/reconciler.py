"""Full-scan reconciliation for the Obsidian connector.

Walks the vault tree, hashes every file the connector is configured to
index, compares against a caller-supplied "known state" (hash of the
last successfully-ingested copy keyed by ``item_id``) and emits
:class:`~kairix.core.protocols.ChangeEvent` records for the drift.

This catches the case watchdog events miss: every change that fired
while the worker was paused (process restart, suspend/resume, machine
hibernation). The connector pipeline runs the reconciler every Nth
``list_changes`` call AND whenever the cursor is ``None`` (the
first-ever sync).

Per the layered design (F35), the reconciler does NOT reach into the
``documents`` table directly — instead it accepts a ``known_state``
mapping that the orchestration layer (``kairix/core/connectors/``)
populates from whatever store it owns. Tests pass a dict; production
passes the result of a SQLite ``SELECT path, hash FROM documents``.
