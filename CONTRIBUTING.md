Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for engineering standards and [CONSTRAINTS.md](CONSTRAINTS.md) for hard boundaries before starting.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/three-cubes/kairix
cd kairix
make setup-dev
```

`make setup-dev` runs `scripts/dev/setup.sh` — it checks prerequisites (Python 3.12+, pip, git), installs kairix with the canonical CI extras set, and wires the pre-commit hooks. Idempotent; safe to re-run after pulling new deps.

To dry-run (report what would change without installing): `make setup-check`.

For granular control:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,agents,markitdown,pdf_fallback,ocr,pptx,docx,xlsx]"
make setup           # pre-commit hooks only
```

### Fitness-check config (F73 private-infra patterns)

The F73 token-pattern scanner loads its pattern set from org config in the
`three-cubes` org — single-sourced for CI and local dev. CI reads the org
secret; locally you fetch the org variable (org-member-readable) with the
`gh` CLI:

```bash
# Export into your current shell (preferred):
eval "$(bash scripts/fetch-fitness-config.sh)"

# Or cache it to the gitignored .private-infra-patterns fallback file:
make fitness-config
```

Without the patterns the scanner is a no-op locally, so the commit gate
passes — CI is still the backstop. The hand-maintained
`.private-infra-patterns` file is a last-resort fallback/cache only; the
org variable is the canonical local source.

## Making changes

Kairix is trunk-based on `main`, and every change lands through a PR that **merges itself on green** — there is no routine direct push (the ruleset requires both status checks on every merge).

1. Branch off latest `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Commit via the gated script: `bash scripts/safe-commit.sh "your message"`. It runs lint, format, mypy, tests, security checks, and Sonar new-code parity — fix and re-run on any failure. For docs/CHANGELOG-only edits, `--fast` skips the heavy test suite.
4. Push, then open a PR **authored by the `three-cubes-agent` GitHub App** (short-lived installation token via WIF / Key Vault; never a human account). A PR author can't approve their own PR, so App-authorship is what lets a human maintainer review a control-plane change.
5. The PR **auto-merges the moment both required checks are green** — **`CI gate`** (the `check` fan-in in `1 · Quality gate`) and **`PR compliance check`** (`2 · Pre-merge PR gates`) — with no human running the merge.

A diff that touches a control-plane path in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) (CI/merge machinery, the gate definition, governance canon, deploy/runtime config) **holds for a `@three-cubes/maintainers` review** instead of auto-merging; everything else (src, tests, feature docs) merges unattended. The `main` ruleset has **zero bypass actors** — no `--admin` rescue, even for an owner. Merge method is a **merge commit** (`--merge`); squash is disabled so per-commit history is the audit trail. Author every commit as the canonical `three-cubes-agent` App identity with **no AI/LLM self-attribution** — see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); the `canonical_commit_identity` + `no_llm_attribution` gates enforce it.

**Replay the exact CI gate locally before you push (the inner-loop rule in [tc-pipelines `governance/STANDARDS.md`](https://github.com/three-cubes/tc-pipelines/blob/main/governance/STANDARDS.md)).** Run the same commands CI runs — `uv sync --all-extras --all-groups`, then `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` and `uv run tc-fitness run`. Never push or let a PR merge over a red gate; regenerate and stage any generated artifacts before committing. `safe-commit.sh` wraps this for the inner loop, but the gate above is the bar.

## Running tests

```bash
# All tests that must pass before commit (same as safe-commit.sh)
pytest tests/ -m "unit or bdd or contract" -x --timeout=30

# Integration (requires real SQLite index)
pytest tests/ -m integration -v

# E2E composed production path (CI Stage 4.5)
pytest tests/e2e/ -m e2e -v

# Soak tier (nightly on main; not part of the PR gate)
pytest tests/ -m soak -v
```

## Testing approach

Tests use protocol fakes, not monkey-patches. See `tests/fakes.py` for fake implementations and `tests/contracts/test_protocols.py` for protocol compliance patterns.

```python
from tests.fakes import FakeClassifier, FakeDocumentRepository
from kairix.core.factory import build_search_pipeline

pipeline = build_search_pipeline(
    paths=FakePaths(...),
    classifier=FakeClassifier(),
    document_repository=FakeDocumentRepository(documents=[...]),
)
result = pipeline.search("test query")
```

Construct pipelines through `kairix.core.factory.build_*`, not by direct `SearchPipeline(...)` / `EmbedPipeline(...)` construction. F46/F47/F48 enforce this. See [CONSTRAINTS.md](CONSTRAINTS.md) and [`docs/architecture/test-discipline-hardening.md`](docs/architecture/test-discipline-hardening.md) for the full specification.

## Architecture

Protocols define every boundary. Pipelines compose protocols. Factories build production pipelines. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full architecture overview.

Key files for contributors:
- `kairix/core/protocols.py` — all domain boundary interfaces
- `kairix/core/factory.py` — how production pipelines are constructed
- `kairix/core/search/pipeline.py` — the search pipeline orchestrator
- `tests/fakes.py` — fake implementations for testing

## Branching model

Trunk-based on `main` — every change targets `main` through a PR.

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | **Default branch.** All work lands here via PR; release tags point at `main` SHAs. |
| `feat/*`, `fix/*` | Human feature branches for grouped commits, release stabilisation, or external review — PR targets `main`. |
| `agent/*` | Branches authored by the `three-cubes-agent` GitHub App — PR targets `main`. |

Branch prefixes are convention: kairix does not bind the `branch_naming` gate. The canonical cross-repo branch shape `<user>/<team>-<number>-<slug>`, enforced by `branch_naming` in repos that bind it, lives in [tc-pipelines `governance/STANDARDS.md`](https://github.com/three-cubes/tc-pipelines/blob/main/governance/STANDARDS.md).

The `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/...` URLs in [README.md](README.md) and [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) point at `main`, which serves both as default and as the last-released compose source.

## Versioning

CalVer: `YYYY.M.D`. Pre-release: `YYYY.M.DaN`.

## Cutting a release

Cut a release only with explicit per-action authorisation — releases ship to shared infra (HITL).

1. Validate on the deployment target.
2. Confirm `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` section is fully populated (no empty sub-sections) and the version label matches CalVer (`vYYYY.M.D[aN]`).
3. Trigger the **`5 · Release`** workflow (Actions tab → workflow_dispatch) with `version=vYYYY.M.D[aN]`. It tags `main` HEAD, extracts the `[Unreleased]` CHANGELOG section as release notes, and creates the GitHub Release. The release-created event then fires Docker + PyPI publish workflows automatically.

An **alpha prerelease** triggers the VM deploy: `release-vm-deploy.yml` calls the tc-pipelines `azure-vm-deploy.yml@v1` reusable (see [ADR-017](docs/architecture/ADR-017-deployment-architecture.md)) — snapshot skipped, rollback by re-pinning `KAIRIX_IMAGE_TAG`, post-apply probe = `kairix onboard check`.

See [scripts/release-checklist.md](scripts/release-checklist.md) for the full end-to-end checklist including post-deploy validation.
